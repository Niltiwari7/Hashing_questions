# Hashing_questions
In this basic question of hashing is solved
**what is hashing?**
Hashing refers to the process of generating a fixed-size output from an input of variable size using the mathematical formulas known as hash functions. This technique determines an index or location for the storage of an item in a data structure.

**Need for Hash data structure**
It can store the data and search in it in constant time, i.e. in O(1) time. 

**Components of Hashing**
There are majorly three components of hashing:

**Key:** A Key can be anything string or integer which is fed as input in the hash function the technique that determines an index or location for storage of an item in a data structure. 
**Hash Function:** The hash function receives the input key and returns the index of an element in an array called a hash table. The index is known as the hash index.

**Hash Table:** Hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a special function called a hash function. Hash stores the data in an associative manner in an array where each data value has its own unique index.
